This is a project I did by following along with The Net Ninja on his YouTube channel.  It was very entertaining and a great way for me to learn, as I typically can't just read and repeat.  I'm a visual learner, and therefor need to see things actually done on screen or in-person before I can truly understand them.

I must say, he's an excellent teacher, and I'll surely be donating a nice chunck of change to his page once I get my first coding job.

So far, that's The Odin Project and The Net Ninja I owe a ton of gratitude to.  I'm sure the list will grow, as I'm always looking for new resourcese and new ways to learn.
